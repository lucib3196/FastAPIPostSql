    Your task is to rewrite and improve the description.

    Guidelines:

    - Keep it short and punchy: about 750 characters max.
    - Expand slightly on what the user originally wrote, adding flair or small funny details, but don‚Äôt lose the original intent.
    - The final description should feel like a witty Pok√©dex entry that makes readers smile while still giving useful info.
    - Reminder that these are essentially Pok√©mon, so the tone should highlight their animal-like qualities while also giving them fun and loving personalities.
    
    Additionally you are tasked with generating an image description for the pokemon
    This description will expand on the physical attributes provided by the user and use the description as well to take into account. The description should be 
    descriptive of the pokemons feature as it will be used for image generation, but also keep it in the style of the pokedex so it can work as an individual description as well

pokemon_moveset_prompt = """
You are designing a moveset for a fan-created Pok√©mon-inspired creature. 
Base your moves on the creature‚Äôs type(s), physical attributes, and personality.

### Requirements:
- Provide **3 moves** that fit the creature at its current evolutionary stage.
- Each move must include:
  - **Move Name**
  - **Type** (must align with or complement the Pok√©mon‚Äôs type)
  - **Category** (Physical / Special / Status)
  - **Description** (short, fun explanation of what the move does, in a Pok√©mon-style flavor)
  - **sprite_animation**: a 4-step frame breakdown describing exactly how the move would look in sprite form.

### Sprite Animation Guidelines:
- Always provide exactly 4 frames.
- Each frame should describe: body pose, facial expression, secondary effects (particles, light, ripples, sparks, etc.), and transitions between frames.
- Make the loop flow naturally, with a clear visual start and finish for pixel artists.
- Keep details fun and expressive, in line with Pok√©mon-style battle animations.

pokemon_cute_animations = """
You are designing playful, non-combat animations for a fan-created, Pok√©mon-inspired creature.
These are not battle moves ‚Äî they are cute, goofy, or endearing expressions that showcase personality.

Generate EXACTLY 4 distinct personality-based animations.

Constraints:
- Each animation must be described in DETAIL, enough for a pixel artist to create 2‚Äì6 looping frames.
- Include a `sprite_animation` field: a step-by-step guide with exactly 4 entries, each describing a single frame‚Äôs pose, expression, and effects.
- Go beyond one sentence: describe body movements, facial expressions, secondary effects (like bubbles, sparks, ripples), and how the loop resets smoothly.
- Tone: lighthearted, charming, anime/Pok√©dex side-content vibes.
- Avoid combat terms (damage, accuracy, power, status conditions).
- Prefer the creature‚Äôs typing ({ptype}); Normal-type allowed for neutral actions.
- Each animation must include:
  ‚Ä¢ Name
  ‚Ä¢ Type
  ‚Ä¢ Category: ["Flavor", "Cute", "Playful"]
