# Example 3 (Electric-type, energetic personality)
1. Spark Bounce (Electric, Playful, happy, dance) ‚Äî Bounces in place with little sparks popping at its feet each time it lands.
2. Static Fluff (Electric, Cute, silly, reaction) ‚Äî Shakes itself, puffing up with static-charged fur that sticks out messily.
